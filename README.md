# My Ghidra scripts

A collection of some useful Ghidra scripts I come up with.
This is a personal repository. So while you can open issues,
I won't guarantee any bug fixes, improvements, etc.

## Documentation

Each script has a `.md` file with its documentation.

## Install

Copy the script(s) (you like to use) to your `ghidra_scripts` folder (usually located
at `~/ghidra_scripts`) or any other directory Ghidra is configured to search for
scripts.
