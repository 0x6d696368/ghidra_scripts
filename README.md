# My Ghidra scripts

A collection of some useful Ghidra scripts I come up with.
This is a personal repository. So while you can open issues,
I won't guarantee any bug fixes, improvements, etc.

Scripts only tested with CentOS 7.

## Documentation

Each script has a `.md` file with its documentation.

## Dependencies

- pipeDecoder.py: none (that I know of)
- YaraSearch.py: `yara` must be in `$PATH`


## Install

Copy the script(s) (you like to use) to your `ghidra_scripts` folder (usually located
at `~/ghidra_scripts`) or any other directory Ghidra is configured to search for
scripts.

## Acknowledgments

All development powered via [curl cheat.sh/python/](https://cheat.sh/python/).
